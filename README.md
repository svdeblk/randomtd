# Welcome to the RTD Wiki!

### What is this Wiki?

This Wiki has been (and still is) a long work-in-progress. I began it out of the deep interest I found in the game. In the last 6 months, I have been collecting bits and pieces of random info, stats, walkthroughs, and much more. This is my attempt at finally parsing all of that data and turning it into an open sourced, dialogue-friendly community database that can evolve over time.
